Shakespeare's Sonnets
============================================

Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summers lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst,
Nor shall Death brag thou wandrest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growst.
 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
